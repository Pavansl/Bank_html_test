        <h3><i>FATCA and CRS</i></h3>
        <p>
            The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a piece of US tax regulation that aims to combat tax evasion by US persons opening accounts offshore. 
            FATCA became effective July 1, 2014. It enhances due diligence and information reporting requirements for both individual and entity accounts. 
            On 9 July 2015, India signed Model 1 Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the US IRS for implementation of FATCA.
